# TwitchSpamBlocker
Recently, there has been a rise in the spamming bots on Twitch. I thought I'd make a solution based on what I see happening.

This is the kind of problem that needs immediate attention. Otherwise, chat experiences could be completely ruined. I've actually seen these bots become subbed and continue spamming in follower-only/sub-only modes.

I've taken the matter into my own hands and would appreciate community help if you are interested!
